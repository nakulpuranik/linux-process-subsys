Assignment : Write a program in which parent process waits till its child process terminates.

Description :
This code creates new thread child and parent process waits till the child is terminated.

Note :
When vfork is used to ensure that the child executes first, and not explicite call to _exit() is made, then the program is in loop.
Why this behaviour ?
Currently only vfork with call to exit  function is used.
